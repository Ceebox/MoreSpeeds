## Description
A [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) mod for the game [Gladio Mori](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2689120/Gladio_Mori/), allowing for a variety of faster (and goofier) speeds of play.

## Warning
This mod will make your game unstable! Gladio Mori uses Unity's TimeScale feature to manipulate the pace of the game, which is what allows this modification to work. Increasing the TimeScale is not recommended as it causes inaccuracy, and also massively increases the load on your computer.
If you go to 10x, there is a very high chance your game will crash unless your computer is decent.

Also, due to the inaccuracies introduced into the physics engine by the higher speeds, your appendages will move further than intended, causing frequent damage to your own player!

## So, why did you make this?
Because, it is super fun. I initially meddled around with decompiling the original demo, and me and my friends played for hours, running the game at continuously faster paces than intended and it was hilarious. I hope you have as much fun as I do with this mod!

## Contributing / Development
I likely won't be taking contributions to this mod, unless it breaks and I don't have the time to fix it.

However, if you wish to take this mod further (though it would likely be worth rewriting in your own style), then you will need a development environment for BepinEx set up, and you will also need to own the Gladio Mori game.
From there, you can add Gladio Mori's Assembly-CSharp as an assembly reference (mine likely won't match up with your install), and away you go!
